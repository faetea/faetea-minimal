I sewed these items to wear at Burning Man 2014.

In middle school, my mom helped me sew Jedi robes for myself and my brother. I've worn the cloaks many times over the last decade, and in 2014 I refashioned one of the cloaks into a wrap vest to wear at Burning Man.

Bra embellished with rubber feathers hand cut from bicycle inner tubes. These black feathers are meticulously cut by hand from discarded bike inner tubes, and then sewn onto a bra using a leather needle.
